Arduino-Interpreter
===================

Use the C++ Interpreter for connecting the PC with your Arduino.

Use the console to send commands, like "digitalWrite", "pinmode", etc.

At 'main.cpp', you can see a "OPTIONS" lines. You can modify it for setting your Arduino's Serial port, and the number of pins of your Arduino (Arduino UNO for default).
