Arduino-Interpreter
===================

Use the C++ Interpreter to connect your PC with an Arduino.

Use the console to send commands, like "digitalWrite", "pinmode", etc.

At 'main.cpp', you can see a "OPTIONS" lines. You can modify it to set your Arduino's Serial port and the number of pins of your Arduino (Arduino UNO by default).
